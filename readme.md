# Russian Roulette
A very simple russian roulette game made in Kotlin that will shut down your computer when the gun fires.
This game was originally terminal-based and made in Lua, but it has been ported to use the Swing UI library.

Currently, the shutdown part only works on Windows. I have not yet added support for other operating systems' shutdown procedures.
